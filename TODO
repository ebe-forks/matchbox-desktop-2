- read mbdesktop1 categories map file
- create multiple pages
- combo to select category
- if keynav failed switch to prev/next category

Favourite Idea 1
- use GtkRecent to store the count of apps being started
- show top 10 most run apps

Favourite Idea 2
- Just have a context menu to add/remove apps to the favourite group

Single Instance
- Need to support matchbox single instance hack
- Support GtkUnique directly via keys in desktop files?

Misc
- sorting assumes icontile.  add taku_tile_get_sort_key() and in icon tile
  return the primary.
